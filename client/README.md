## Overview

### What This Application Does

Itemizer is a full-stack web application that helps organizations and individual
users keep track of their inventories. The idea is to only count their items of
each type only once, and they can adjust the quantities of their non-stock items
after each usage, to avoid having to count everything again. The goal is to have
members of an organization identify shortages of items as soon as possible, instead
of noticing when such an item has been depleted. 

When identifying when an item will be depleted, versus when an item is actually
depleted, managers are able to purchase more of that item and will be received
to the organization sooner, or less waiting time to be brief. In fact, the idea
is to make it appear that members don't have to wait at all. When there are
still items left, members of organizations don't have to hold off on any
projects that they were working on that required the item.

### Why This Application was Created

In an an organization that I was previously a part of, we did not have an
efficient system for keeping track of our inventories. We have tried
many ways to do it, such as using spreadsheet and writing numbers on
each item. Finally, the idea was proposed to create an application, powered
by a database to manage invnetory. This solution has many of the following 
benefits that other solutions did not:

- It's much more GUI-friendly
- This solution is long-term. Even if the creator leaves, the website could still
function.
- No formatting required.
- Informtion is accessed and correctly updated within seconds.
- Has the ability to notify other members about the status of their inventory.
- Data is stored in a more efficient and secure way, versus on a spreadsheet.
Spreadsheets are not meant for data storage, but for accounting or data analysis.

By taking advantage of the benefits that a web application would offer, I was
able to create a minimum viable product that any company, organization, or
even family home can use to keep track of their items in a easy, convenient,
manner.

The purpose of organizations is to ensure that one organization's item count
is local to that organization and likewise for another organization. This is
to prevent two organizations from showing the same item count in their database
when in reality they have different quantities. For example, I live in my house
and you live in yours. We would definitely have different numbers of toilet
paper rolls that we have left. The counts would always need to be local instead
of global.

This is also part of my Flatrion School Phase 4 project, where I've been
tasked to create a full stack web application using everything that I learned in
this phase and the other phases.

### Technologies

With this being a full stack web application, several technologies have been used
to power it. On the frontend, the languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
with JavaScript being simplified with the framework ReactJS. In this
application, you could navigate to ten different pages. This was made possible
with React Router DOM v6.

On the backend, the technologies used were Python, Flask, and SQLite. With Flask,
I was able to simplify the use of SQLite by creating SQL commands using Flask
SQL Alchemy, instead of having to write all my queries manually. I was also
able to use Flask Restful to create a DRY RESTFul API for all my resources.
The SQLite database consists of six tables:

One last technology used to power the development of this application is
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Vite is, according to the website, is a build
tool for faster and leaner development for modern web projects. I would like to
give my instructor, Enoch Griffith, for providing me with the Vite template to
develop my app on.

### Limitations

Currently, the users' accounts are not real. All the emails and users are fake
information, generated by Python's faker library. This application is 
not in deployment, which means that you would have to fork and clone this
repository, and run both the frontend and backend using two different terminals.
Also, since there is no API that allows users to send notifications, when a user
clicks the *Send Update* button, nothing would really happen. And it goes without
saying that users would not be notified of anything that pertains to them.
All these limitations will hopefully be corrected in the next iteration of
this project.

## Installation & Execution

### Installation

The good news is that installing this application is quite easy. But before proceeding
to install, ensure that you have Node v16.20.2 and Python v3.9.2 installed on your local
machine (if that's where you intend to install to). This project is saved in my
[Flatiron School Phase 4 Project on Github](https://github.com/adnanian/itemizer).
Once you open the repository, you then fork and clone your own instance on your machine.


### Execution

Open the project on VS Code. Once VS Code is loaded, open a second terminal. On the
first terminal you will run `pipenv install && pipenv shell`. You would need to wait
for about a minute or two to install all the necessary python extensions on your
machine. Once you're in the python shell, navigate to the server directory by
typing `cd server`. An optional step that you can take from there is to re-seed
the database by running `python seed.py`. This will create a full database of 
users, items, and organizations, and populate them with members, assigned items,
in an organization, and requests for certain users to join an organization.
Finally, to power the backend, while still in the server directory, run
`python app.py`. The terminal would show all requests made by the frontend
to the API. Take not of them.

**Note: Make sure you run the backend while in pipenv shell**.

On the other terminal, do not navigate to any directory. Instead, you will run
`npm install` to install all JS and React-related extensions. Once that is finished,
you will run `npm run dev --prefix client` to start the frontend process of the application.
The terminal will then show a Vite logo, and a link to open the web application.
Clickin on the link, you should see the application:
