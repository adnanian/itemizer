## Overview

### What This Application Does

Itemizer is a full-stack web application that helps organizations and individual
users keep track of their inventories. The idea is to only count their items of
each type only once, and they can adjust the quantities of their non-stock items
after each usage, to avoid having to count everything again. The goal is to have
members of an organization identify shortages of items as soon as possible, instead
of noticing when such an item has been depleted. 

When identifying when an item will be depleted, versus when an item is actually
depleted, managers are able to purchase more of that item and will be received
to the organization sooner, or less waiting time to be brief. In fact, the idea
is to make it appear that members don't have to wait at all. When there are
still items left, members of organizations don't have to hold off on any
projects that they were working on that required the item.

### Why This Application was Created

In an an organization that I was previously a part of, we did not have an
efficient system for keeping track of our inventories. We have tried
many ways to do it, such as using spreadsheet and writing numbers on
each item. Finally, the idea was proposed to create an application, powered
by a database to manage invnetory. This solution has many of the following 
benefits that other solutions did not:

- It's much more GUI-friendly
- This solution is long-term. Even if the creator leaves, the website could still
function.
- No formatting required.
- Informtion is accessed and correctly updated within seconds.
- Has the ability to notify other members about the status of their inventory.
- Data is stored in a more efficient and secure way, versus on a spreadsheet.
Spreadsheets are not meant for data storage, but for accounting or data analysis.

By taking advantage of the benefits that a web application would offer, I was
able to create a minimum viable product that any company, organization, or
even family home can use to keep track of their items in a easy, convenient,
manner.

The purpose of organizations is to ensure that one organization's item count
is local to that organization and likewise for another organization. This is
to prevent two organizations from showing the same item count in their database
when in reality they have different quantities. For example, I live in my house
and you live in yours. We would definitely have different numbers of toilet
paper rolls that we have left. The counts would always need to be local instead
of global.

This is also part of my Flatrion School Phase 4 project, where I've been
tasked to create a full stack web application using everything that I learned in
this phase and the other phases.

### Technologies

With this being a full stack web application, several technologies have been used
to power it. On the frontend, the languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
with JavaScript being simplified with the framework ReactJS. In this
application, you could navigate to ten different pages. This was made possible
with React Router DOM v6.

On the backend, the technologies used were Python, Flask, and SQLite. With Flask,
I was able to simplify the use of SQLite by creating SQL commands using Flask
SQL Alchemy, instead of having to write all my queries manually. I was also
able to use Flask Restful to create a DRY RESTFul API for all my resources.
The SQLite database consists of six tables:

![Itemizer Table Relations](/client/public/images/README/Itemizer%20Schema.png)

One last technology used to power the development of this application is
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Vite is, according to the website, is a build
tool for faster and leaner development for modern web projects. I would like to
give my instructor, Enoch Griffith, for providing me with the Vite template to
develop my app on.

### Limitations

Currently, the users' accounts are not real. All the emails and users are fake
information, generated by Python's faker library. This application is 
not in deployment, which means that you would have to fork and clone this
repository, and run both the frontend and backend using two different terminals.
Also, since there is no API that allows users to send notifications, when a user
clicks the *Send Update* button, nothing would really happen. And it goes without
saying that users would not be notified of anything that pertains to them. The
report form doesn't actually submit any reports. It just simulates a report
submission. When you click the "Forgot Password" link, it just takes you
to a page saying that it will be implemented later. So be sure to remember
your password.

All these limitations will hopefully be corrected in the next iteration of
this project.

## Installation & Execution

### Installation

The good news is that installing this application is quite easy. But before proceeding
to install, ensure that you have Node v16.20.2 and Python v3.9.2 installed on your local
machine (if that's where you intend to install to). This project is saved in my
[Flatiron School Phase 4 Project on Github](https://github.com/adnanian/itemizer).
Once you open the repository, you then fork and clone your own instance on your machine.


### Execution

Open the project on VS Code. Once VS Code is loaded, open a second terminal. On the
first terminal you will run `pipenv install && pipenv shell`. You would need to wait
for about a minute or two to install all the necessary python extensions on your
machine. Once you're in the python shell, navigate to the server directory by
typing `cd server`. An optional step that you can take from there is to re-seed
the database by running `python seed.py`. This will create a full database of 
users, items, and organizations, and populate them with members, assigned items,
in an organization, and requests for certain users to join an organization.
Finally, to power the backend, while still in the server directory, run
`python app.py`. The terminal would show all requests made by the frontend
to the API. Take not of them.

**Note: Make sure you run the backend while in pipenv shell**.

On the other terminal, do not navigate to any directory. Instead, you will run
`npm install` to install all JS and React-related extensions. Once that is finished,
you will run `npm run dev --prefix client` to start the frontend process of the application.
The terminal will then show a Vite logo, and a link to open the web application.
Clickin on the link, you should see the application:

## Usage

### Creating an Account

You will need to create an account by going to the login page, then clicking on
the link that says **Don't have an account? Click here to signup**.

Next fill out all the information in the signup form. Once you've done that,
click on the checkbox that you've agreed to the terms and conditions. (There
currently are none.) And click on the submit button.

If you filled out all information correctly, you will be redirected to the login
page.

### Logging In

Login with your new account, or any account in the database. For the purposes of
development, all users are generated by python seed. Users have a fake username
in the format of first initial, last name, and a number consisting
of 4 digits. (Some users may have more digits to ensure that all usernames are
at least 8 characters in length.) The emails are in the format of
firstname.lastnameNUMBER_FROM_USERNAME@itemizer.com. **(@itemizer.com is not a
real domain name at this time.)**

Example:
- Name: John Smith
- Username: jsmith1234
- Email: john.smith1234@itemizer.com

Log in using the username/email and password. Upon successful login, you will be
redirected to the home page with a new set of navigational links.

### Home Page

![What the logged in user sees](/client/public/images/README/Home%20Page.png)

In the home page, you can see all items that are in the system. The new navigational
bar consists of the following links:
- About - the about section.
- Organizations - a page of all organizations in the system and the user's memberships.
- Settings - a page to manage the user's profile.
- Logout - logs the user out of his/her account.

### Organizations Page

Clicking the **Organizations** link will take you to the organizations page. It
consists of two radio buttons that you select to display one of the following
views:
- All Organizations - displays a table of all organizations that exist in the system.
- My Organizations - displays a tile for each organization that the logged in user
belongs to.

There is also a button, *Create an organization*, that allows you to create a
new organization under your ownership.

#### All Organizations

![Table of all organizations in the system](/client/public/images/README/Organizations%20Table.png)

The table will display the organization's basic information along side
one of three different elements in the last column:

- All organizations that the user is a member of will be highlighted in green
with the appropriate message.
- All organizations that the user has requested to join will be highlighted in
yellow with the appropriate message.
- All other organizations will show an orange button that a user can click to request
to join. The button displays a form that the user has to fill out to submit. Once
the request has been submitted, then the status will change to the yellow message.

#### My Organizations

![Tiles of all organizations that the user is a member of](/client/public/images/README/User's%20Memberships.png)

This page displays all organizations that you are part of. It includes needed
information as well as your current role.

There are three membership roles:
- REGULAR
    - basic access to the organization; can view other members, add new items, and
adjust quantities.
- ADMIN
    - can manage membership access, process requests, remove items, and has
    other priveleges that a REGULAR does.
- OWNER
    - can modify or delete the organization itself, and has other privelges
    that REGULAR and ADMINS do. **THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE OWNER PER ORGANIZATION!**

Clicking on a link will take you to that organization.

## Accessing an Organization's Data

![What a member of an organization will see.](/client/public/images/README/Organization%20View.png)

In this page, you will see a line of buttons, which will be different
depending on your role. These buttons perform different tasks, that were
discussed in the previous section.

You will also see a pink card for each
item that the organization is using. It includes a picture, its quantity,
and two buttons to adjust the quantities as needed.

To adjust a quantity, click the minus or plus button. A modal form
will display and prompt you to enter a number to subtract or add.
The new quantity would summarily be updated to the system.

## Miscellaneous Features

All other features that were discussed but not demonstrated here are more-or-less
self explanatory and is recommended for you to check out for yourself.


## Future Plans

I plan to improve the application by fixing the limitations as 
noted in the Limitations section. In addition to that, I also plan
to do the following:

- Invite users to join your organization.
- Search bars for items, assignments, and organizations.
- Make items private or public so that users don't have to
publish sensitive information.
- Allow users to edit the names of their items or remove them from
the system altogether.
- Create a subscription plan for organizations and users to use, to keep
this application running.
